# Percolation and growth
The models in this chapter provide a basis for both models of landscape pattern, and for diffusive spread through such landscapes. The underlying basis of all these models is percolation which partitions a space into either occupied or unoccupied sites either all at once, or sequentially according to some simple rule, to yield a wide variety of models of growth processes.
