[![](2.4-inhomPoisson.png)](2.4-inhomPoisson.nlogo){style="float:left; margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:5px;"} This is model demonstrates an inhomogeneous Poisson point process in which the probability of a point event occurring varies from place to place across the area of interest. You will need the `r` and `palette` extensions to run this model.
