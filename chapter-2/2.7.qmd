This model demonstrates a double Thomas point process where consecutive ‘generations’ of point events originate from the location of ‘parent’ events. Although the process is not intended as a dynamic model, it clearly shows how we can progress from a static to a dynamic model, similar to that of [Flügge et al](2.2.qmd).
