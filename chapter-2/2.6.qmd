[![](2.6-cluster.png)](2.6-cluster.nlogo){style="float:left; margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:5px;"} This model demonstrates Thomas and Matern point processes which can be tuned to produce patterns that exhibit distinct clusters of events. You will need the `r` and `palette` extensions to run this model.
