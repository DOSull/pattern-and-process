[![](5.15-edenSingleOnLineLDD.png)](5.15-edenSingleOnLineLDD-using-R.nlogo){style="float:left; margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:5px;"} This model shows how Eden spread along a front is dramatically altered by the occurrence of even relatively rare long-distance jumps. The behaviour of this model should be compared with that of the same model without such jumps.

This model requires the R extension.
