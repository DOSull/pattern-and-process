[![](5.20-FFM-ContLsp.png)](5.20-FFM-ContLsp.nlogo){style="float:left; margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:5px;"} This model is a forest fire model where the flammability of sites changes with the time elapsed since the site last burned. The focus of this model is on the relationship between the ‘flammability function’ and the resulting distribution of fire sizes, and on how ‘memory’ in the landscapes contributes to the overall patterns that result.

This model draws on ideas in
