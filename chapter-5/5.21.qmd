This model is an approximate implementation of the model described in

Stark CP. 1994. Cluster growth modeling of plateau erosion. _Journal of Geophysical Research_ **99** 13957-69.

which combines invasion percolation, diffusion-limited aggregation and Eden growth to simulated gullying erosion at a plateau edge.
