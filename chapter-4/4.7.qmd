A flocking model loosely based on ideas in

Czirók A and T Vicsek. 2000. Collective behavior of interacting self-propelled particles. _Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications_ **281** 17–29.

Grégoire G, H Chaté H and Y Tu. 2003. Moving and staying together without a leader. _Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena_ **181** 157–70.

Vicsek T, A Czirók, E Ben-Jacob, I Cohen and O Sochet. 1995. Novel type of phase transition in a system of self-driven particles. _Physical Review Letters_ **75** 1226–29.

This model also includes various different implementations of the idea of ‘flock-mates’ which demonstrate the importance of basic spatial properties (in this case proximity or ‘neighbourhood’) in many spatial models.

Typical behaviour of this model is seen in the video below.
