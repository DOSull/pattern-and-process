Here we present a model that uses elements from all the ‘building-block’ models presented in Chapters 3, 4 and 5 to develop a more complicated and detailed model. The island coastline is formed by [invasion percolation](../chapter-5/5.5.qmd), resources are distributed according to [local averaging](../chapter-3/3.1.qmd) and [cluster formation](../chapter-5/5.18.qmd), hunter-gatherers move using variations on [random walk](../chapter-4/4.1.qmd) and [foraging](../chapter-4/4.3.qmd), and so on.

A detailed description of the model is available [here](model_details.pdf).

In later work, we published detailed results from this model as

Perry GLW and D O’Sullivan. 2018. [Identifying narrative descriptions in agent-based models representing past human-environment interactions](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10816-017-9355-x). _Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory_, **25**(3) 795-813.

Typical behaviour of this model is seen in the video below.
