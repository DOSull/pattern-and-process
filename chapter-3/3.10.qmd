This model is one possible implementation of Thomas Schelling’s simple model of residential segregation. This implementation shows how changing the criterion for how a household decides that a prospective new location is acceptable or not can change the overall outcome quite dramatically.  The original papers on this model are:

It has more recently been argued that the model should be more properly referred to as the Sakoda-Schelling model. See:

Hegselmann R. 2017. [Thomas C. Schelling and James M. Sakoda: The intellectual, technical, and social history of a model](https://dx.doi.org/10.18564/jasss.3511). _Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation_ **20**(3).

Typical behaviour of this model is seen in the video below.
