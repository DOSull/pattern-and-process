[![](3.14-spots-and-stripes.png)](3.14-spots-and-stripes.nlogo){style="float:left; margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:5px;"} This model implements the cellular automaton model described by

which is itself a cellular automaton discretisation of Turing’s reaction-diffusion model of morphogenetics.

The reaction-diffusion model is a fundamental process model across many scientific domains.
