[![](3.3-totalistic_automata.png)](3.3-totalistic-automata.nlogo){style="float:left; margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:5px;"} This model allows you to explore the behaviour of a wide variety of possible totalistic automata, i.e., cellular automata whose rules are based only on the total number of cells in each neighbourhood in each of the two allowed states.

An example is the majority rule automaton which you can see running in this video. 

Here the rule is that each cell adopts the state that is in the majority in its neighbourhood at the next time step.
