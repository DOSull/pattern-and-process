A simple implementation of John Conwayâ€™s game of life cellular automaton.

See also the [totalistic automata model](../chapter-3/3.3.qmd), which allows a wide range of the cellular automata models of which life is just an example to be explored. Also of interest may be the [effect on the life CA of changing how we represent time](../chapter-6/6.1.qmd).
